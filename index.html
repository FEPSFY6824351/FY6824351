This article talks about the Challenger disaster in 1986 and how the whole catastrophe happened because of a small, simple part of the rocket, the O-ring, faulting due to something as straight forward as the weather conditions. Also how the people running the operation chose to neglect a concern which could have saved 7 lives, including Sharon McAuliffe who should’ve become the first teacher in Space. This failure ended up having a huge impact on NASA and it’s following missions eventually ending the Shuttle program. &nbsp;

On the cold morning of 28th January 1986 (Howell, 2022), the STS-51-L, better known as the Challenger Space Shuttle (Space Shuttle Mission Chronology, 2011), suffered a catastrophic failure 73 seconds into its flight (Howell, 2022) causing the shuttle to rapidly diverge before disintegrating across the coastal waters off Cape Canaveral in Florida (National Library Scotland, 2019). There would be no survivors. Its goal was to launch the ‘2nd tracking and data relay satellite' but the O-rings on the rocket’s boosters deteriorated causing the shuttle to go up in flames (Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2023). This ended up having an enormous impact on not only NASA but also the entire world; the United States government and the public who were watching globally. 
</p>
 
<br>
 
<p class="ex1">
For the first time in Space history, a member of the general public was given the opportunity to join a shuttle mission on the journey into space. On 27th August 1984, President Ronald W. Reagan announced that a teacher would be invited to go on this flight. From more than 10,000 candidates, NASA picked a middle school teacher from New Hampshire, Sharon Christa McAuliffe (Uri, 2021). McAuliffe had previously taken a teaching job at Concord High School in 1982 but not long after, in the summer of 1984, she was selected by NASA causing her to take a year out to prepare for the mission. See figure 1. Sharon would have become the 2nd American woman in Space (NASA, 2004), following on from Sally Ride who flew on the Shuttle mission in 1983 (Zimmerman, 2018).

At 11:39 EST, at Cape Canaveral in Florida, the Challenger rocket was launched (National Library Scotland, 2019). Undesirably, temperatures that day were below freezing which caused the rubber O-rings to disintegrate (Howell, 2022). O-rings are rubber seals that are used on the joints of the solid rocket boosters on a space shuttle to prevent gas from escaping (NES, 2021). The O-rings used on Challenger were produced by a company from Utah called Morton Thiokol. Ideally, the O-rings should have closed tightly shut due to ignition forces, but a test carried out before, in 1977, (using pressurised water), showed that it was possible for the metal parts to be bent out of their position opening a gap resulting in a gas leak (National Library Scotland, 2019). When the material in the rocket boosters heats up it expands and pushes against the sides of the boosters, so the rings are supposed to expand to prevent gas from leaking. Within the first couple minutes of launch, the O-rings failed to expand in 0°C conditions, therefore faulting and created a gap for the contained gas to escape from. The leaking gas heated up and rapidly turned into a flame, breaking into the fuel tank and causing the extremely flammable hydrogen gas to ignite (Feynman.com, no date).
</p> 

<br>
      
<p class="ex1">   
The higher the rocket climbed the worse the gas leak became. After 59 seconds, an 8 ft flame shot out of the gap created, subsequently growing to 40 ft and therefore burning through one of the struts that held the booster’s base to the fuel tank which was holding the flammable liquid hydrogen and oxygen. When the strut broke, the base pivoted causing it to be forced through the fuel tank resulting in the tank collapsing and eventually becoming no more (Encyclopædia Britannica, 2023). See figure 2. Though the concept of a leaking fuel tank and a huge cloud of smoke makes it seem like Challenger was destroyed in an explosion there was mechanically no explosion. This was because there was no detonation, the shuttle was engulfed in a huge fireball created by the hot gas igniting the leaking liquid hydrogen and oxygen (Pruitt, 2016).&nbsp;

<p class="ex1">    
The horrible irony of the whole situation was that the night before the launch, the engineers and the managers of Challenger met to deliberate the concerns of the low temperatures. Following the talk, the managers were not convinced by the severity of the concern and decided to continue with the planned launch (Dixon, 2021). This was a key flaw in NASA’s poor decision-making process. 
</p> 

<br>
      
<p class="ex1">    
At 5pm from the Oval Office in the White House, President Ronald W. Reagan addressed the nation and the rest of the world, mourning the loss of the crew. He stated, ‘We'll continue our quest in space. There will be more shuttle flights and more shuttle crews and, yes, more volunteers, more civilians, more teachers in space. Nothing ends here; our hopes and our journeys continue.’ (Garber, 2004).  
</p>

<br>
      
<p class="ex1"> 
After the catastrophe of Challenger, the Shuttle program was halted for just under 3 years before it was reintroduced and later flew a following 88 successful missions over 14 years. These missions were adapted to build and bring supplies to the International Space Station as well as to carry out research and finish the earlier aims of the earlier shuttle missions. In 2003 when the Challenger disaster seemed to be in the past the STS-107 Columbia disaster happened. This catastrophe, following on from 1986, again stopped the Space Shuttle Program when the rocket disintegrated on re-entry killing its entire crew. After yet another tragedy, NASA was criticised for their decision-making process, risk assessment procedures, and organisation overall, concluding the lessons from Challenger had not been learned (Grady, 2016). 
</p>

<p class="ex1">    
From researching the Challenger disaster, I believe that this incident was not fully the fault of NASA, but many mistakes combined. More intense checks should have been done on the engineering such as simulating the rocket’s launch in different conditions, trialling the materials around the hazardous parts of the rocket such as the fuel tank and listening to the professionals rather than letting poor decisions be made. Though the Columbia disaster followed on from Challenger, the Shuttle program has helped advance Space travel. Had it not happened, many missions like the recent Artemis program (Carruth, 2023) would not have developed, causing it to remain an important part of NASA’s history.
